# Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM-Analysis-and-Clustering

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** metrics using **K-Means Clustering**. It includes important steps such as outlier handling, feature scaling, and silhouette score analysis to evaluate clustering quality.

📁 Dataset
Contains over 334,000+ rows and 14 columns.

Cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing data and inconsistencies.

Key fields: CustomerID, InvoiceDate, Quantity, UnitPrice, etc.

RFM features were derived from the dataset to represent customer behavior.

🧪 Approach
✅ 1. RFM Feature Engineering
Recency: Days since the customer’s last purchase.

Frequency: Total number of purchases.

Monetary: Total revenue generated by the customer.

✅ 2. Outlier Handling (IQR Method)
Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) technique to filter extreme values in all three RFM dimensions.

Resulted in cleaner clusters and more reliable segmentation.

✅ 3. Feature Scaling
Used StandardScaler to normalize the RFM values.

Ensures all features contribute equally during distance-based clustering.

✅ 4. K-Means Clustering
Tried k = 2 to 10, evaluated using Silhouette Scores.

Chose k = 4 for optimal balance between interpretability and cluster quality.

✅ 5. Hierarchical Clustering
Performed Agglomerative Clustering as a comparison model.

Visualized dendrograms and cluster assignments for deeper insights.
📈 Visualizations

🧠 Key Insights
Cluster 1: High spenders with frequent purchases — potential loyal VIPs.
Cluster 2: Infrequent but recent buyers — may be re-targeted.
Cluster 3: Low-value customers — need engagement strategies.
Cluster 4: High recency and low frequency — possible churn risks.
